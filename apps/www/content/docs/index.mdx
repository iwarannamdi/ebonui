Ebon UI is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your web apps.

It primarily features components, blocks, and templates geared towards creating landing pages and user-facing marketing materials that looks stunning both in dark-mode and light-mode.

## Why Ebon UI?

Most UI libraries treat dark mode as an afterthought. Ebon UI was designed from the ground up to **embrace dark mode as the default** but also beautiful on light mode.  

- **Dark-first**: No more tweaking light designs into dark themes.  
- **Futuristic style**: Components built with animations, effects and glass for a modern look.  
- **Fast to use**: Copy and paste in blocks and components, and start building immediately.  
- **Customizable**: Extend styles, effects, and blur levels with Tailwind.

## Who is it for?

Ebon UI is built for:
- **Developers** who want a fast way to ship beautiful Ebon UIs.  
- **Designers** looking for a unique, modern style.  
- **Teams & startups** needing production-ready dark-first layouts.  
- **Contributors** who want to grow an open-source UI library.
