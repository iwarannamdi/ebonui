**Note:** Since Ebon UI was inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/) we have the same installation process.

## Next.js

<Steps>

### Create project

Run the `init` command to create a new Next.js project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

Choose between a Next.js project or a Monorepo.

### Add Components

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ebonui.com/r/ripple-button.json
```

The command above will add the `Ripple Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { RippleButton } from "@/components/ui/ripple-button"
```

```tsx showLineNumbers
<RippleButton>Ripple Button</RippleButton>
```
