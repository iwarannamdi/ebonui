**Note:** Since Ebon UI was inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/) we have the same installation process.

</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create project

Run the `init` command to create a new Next.js project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Add components

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ebonui.com/r/glow-card.json
```

### Import component

The command above will add the `GlowCard` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import { GlowCard } from "@/components/ui/glow-card"

export default function Home() {
  return <GlowCard />
}
```

</Steps>
